# TomTimer
A Timer program. Tested on Windows and Mac. A Java Swing application.

## Adding timers
Enter a time and optional message, for example:\
"5m meeting" - creates a timer that will trigger in 5 minutes, with message "meeting".\
"1h lunch" - creates a timer that will trigger in 1 hour, with message "lunch".\
"1h15m test" - creates a timer that will trigger in 1 hour, 15 minutes, with message "test".\
"10a get coffee" - create a timer at 10am with message get coffee.\
"355p meeting soon" - create a timer that will trigger at 3:55pm today, with message "meeting soon".\

## Sound options
Use the "Sound options" menu to select a custom .wav audio file that will play when a timer triggers. This is the global audio sound.\
Right click on any timer's text to customize the sound for that individual timer.

## Timer options
Use the "Timer Options" menu to toggle "auto restart mode". When set to "on", all timers will restart when they are triggered. (So you can create a timer that triggers every 5 minutes).\
Right click on any timer's text to customize the restart mode for that individual timer.
